# Web-Design-II-Final-Project

This website was created for a local travel business, L’Escape travel. The site aims to promote the business and gain customer trust/confidence.  The client wanted the site to place emphasis on their passion for travel and convey professionalism to clients. It should be distinct from the competitor site, lescapetravel.com. The client has provided text excerpts for the different site pages. A PDF form has also been provided for potential customers to complete. For this site, instead of using the PDF, I opted to using a Google Forms page because I felt it would be more accessible to customers. Images on the site came from the business and various artists from the website “Unsplash.com.” 
Specific client requests were: creating a “Meet Courtney” and “Covid-19” page that are separate from the homepage, include a section listeing services provided by the agency, a start planning button, and customer reviews from Facebook.  Also that the site be mobile responsive.

Design Description
The client wanted a bright beachy website that was simple in design. The home page needed to include scenic vacation images, the company logo, a small description about the business, a “Start Planning” button, and links to Facebook/Instagram posts. The color scheme includes warm browns, whites, and different shades of blue. The navigation links on the top of the page are for the Home, About Courtney, Booking pages and the Reviews/Contact sections of the home page.  The footer of the page includes Courtney’s business information and a “Start Planning” button.

Technologies Used
For the image carousel, quote carousel, and navigation bar, Bootstrap Version 3.3.7 was used. The stylized fonts came from Google API and the name of the fonts can be found at the top of the CSS pages. The palm tree used on the homepage also came from a Google API and can be found in the index.html document. The form page was created with Google Forms. 

Configuration Information
Setting up a Google Form using a business email address is the primary action that the client needs to complete. The old form code would need to be deleted from the startplanning.html page and the new Form code put in its place. There are only two folders for this site, “img” and “css”.  The HTML documents are not in a folder.  

Hosting Information
Since the client has an Instagram and Facebook presence, the internet traffic gets split in a couple of directions. A shared server plan would be an excellent option for the L'escape Travel site. A private server is not recommended because the estimated user traffic is about 212 users per month. This estimation was calculated using the Google Analytics Local Business Study research report. The recommended Web Host and plan is DreamHost’s Shared Unlimited Plan. The benefits of this plan are a free domain name, is low cost ($35.40 for the first year), has unmetered bandwidth, and allows for unlimited traffic/SSD storage.
